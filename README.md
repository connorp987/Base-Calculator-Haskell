# Base-Calculator-Haskell
**Zack Noble** & **Connor Plunkett** <br/>
##### Basic calculator with base calculations

In terminal run the line **ghc baseCalc -o baseCalc** <br/>
Next run **./baseCalc.exe**

The program will prompt the user with “Enter your input:”
By default the program runs in base 10 you can give the program variables and do basic arithmetic operations. 

For Example
Enter your input:
x:=3
Enter your input:
y:=2
Enter your input:
x+y

There are different commands that you can enter into the program at any time: <br/>
**exit/:q** -- Quits the program<br/>
**vars** -- Displays the current values of the variables<br/>
**help** -- Gives the listed commands<br/>
**CurrentBase** -- Displays the current base the program is running in<br/>
**Base** -- Prompts the user to enter a new base for the program to be ran in<br/>

You can change the base of the calculator using the Base function and entering in a base, this will make the program require the user to enter digits in the specified base. 

Variables
We recommend using only lowercase letters when making variables.

Base Entries
If in base 16 for example and you have a digit that is represented by a letter use a capital letter
Example: F1A
